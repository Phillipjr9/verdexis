# Sample Hardhat 3 Project (`node:test` and `viem`)

This project showcases a Hardhat 3 project using the native Node.js test runner (`node:test`) and the `viem` library for Ethereum interactions.

## Project Overview

This example project includes:

- A simple Hardhat configuration file.
- Foundry-compatible Solidity unit tests.
- TypeScript integration tests using [`node:test`](nodejs.org/api/test.html), the new Node.js native test runner, and [`viem`](https://viem.sh/).
- Examples demonstrating how to connect to different types of networks, including locally simulating OP mainnet.

## Usage

### Running Tests

To run all the tests in the project, execute the following command:

```shell
npx hardhat test
```

You can also start a local Hardhat network with no funds or testnet needed:

```shell
npm run node
# or
npx hardhat node
```

You can also selectively run the Solidity or `node:test` tests:

```shell
npx hardhat test solidity
npx hardhat test nodejs
```

### Make a deployment to Sepolia

This project includes an example Ignition module to deploy the contract. You can deploy this module to a locally simulated chain or to Sepolia.

To run the deployment to a local chain:

```shell
npx hardhat ignition deploy ignition/modules/Counter.ts
```

To run the deployment to Sepolia, you need an account with funds to send the transaction. The provided Hardhat configuration includes a Configuration Variable called `SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY`, which you can use to set the private key of the account you want to use.

You can set the `SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY` variable using the `hardhat-keystore` plugin or by setting it as an environment variable.

To set the `SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY` config variable using `hardhat-keystore`:

```shell
npx hardhat keystore set SEPOLIA_PRIVATE_KEY
```

After setting the variable, you can run the deployment with the Sepolia network:

```shell
npx hardhat ignition deploy --network sepolia ignition/modules/Counter.ts
```

### Deploying to mainnet

Create the following environment variables in a safe place (do not commit them):

```shell
export MAINNET_RPC_URL="https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>"
export MAINNET_PRIVATE_KEY="0xYOUR_MAINNET_PRIVATE_KEY"
```

Then deploy the SimilarToken contract to mainnet using the package script:

```shell
npm run deploy:mainnet
```

You can optionally set the initial supply before deployment:

```shell
export INITIAL_SUPPLY=1000000
```

Or run directly with Hardhat:

```shell
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-my-token.ts --network mainnet
```
